# Rigid Body Simulation

This MATLAB project simulates and visualizes different types of torque-free rigid body motions, including dual spin stabilization, rotation about principal axes, and the motion of prolate and oblate ellipsoids. The simulations aim to provide an intuitive understanding of how rigid bodies behave when subjected to torque-free conditions, demonstrating concepts such as the space cone vs. body cone dynamics and the stabilization of rotation in dual-spin systems.

The simulations are built on the foundational work of Yi-Hsuan Chen and are inspired by the theoretical principles illustrated in Dr. Shane Ross's YouTube tutorial on stabilizing rotation in dual-spin spacecraft.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the work of Yi-Hsuan Chen from the University of Maryland, College Park. The original MATLAB code was created by Yi-Hsuan Chen and is intended to demonstrate and visualize the motion of a torque-free rigid body, determining its trajectory in the inertial frame. The example used in this project is derived from a YouTube tutorial by Dr. Shane Ross.
